Universal Extractor is an open source program that can extract files from any type of archive, whether it's a simple zip file, an installation program, or even a Windows Installer (.msi) package. Please see home page for details. The home page is http://www.legroom.net/software/uniextract. I make some updating and improvments because official website has not updated or improvmed for a long time.
